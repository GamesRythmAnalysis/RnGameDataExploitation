# rngame
Software for recording and analyzing inputs during game session (rhythmanalysis)
This project originates from MR students projects at UTBM.

You have three main components : 
- rngame (developped by students) as a simple keylogger for game sessions (currently win and linux)
- all the post-processing, done in R
- the collected data set
