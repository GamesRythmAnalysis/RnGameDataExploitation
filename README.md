# RNGames data exploitation

This repository contains data collected using RNGames during game session (rhythmanalysis) and R scripts to exploits them.
The software can be found [here](https://github.com/GamesRythmAnalysis/RNGames).
It comes from students MR projects (Methodologie Recherche) at UTBM.

There are three main components : 
- [RNGames](https://github.com/GamesRythmAnalysis/RNGames) (developped by students) as a simple keylogger for game sessions (currently Win and Linux)
- the collected data sets
- all the post-processing, done in R (scripts)
