# rngame
Software for recording and analyzing inputs during game session (rhythmanalysis)
It comes from students MR projects (Methodologie Recherche) at UTBM.

You have three main components : 
- rngame (developped by students) as a simple keylogger for game sessions (currently win and linux)
- all the post-processing, done in R (scripts)
- the collected data sets
